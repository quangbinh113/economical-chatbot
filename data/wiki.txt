Canceris a group of diseases involvingabnormal cell growthwith the potential toinvadeorspreadto other parts of the body.These contrast withbenign tumors, which do not spread.Possiblesigns and symptomsinclude a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplainedweight loss, and a change inbowel movements.While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they can also have other causes.Over100 typesof cancers affect humans.
Tobacco useis the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths.Another 10% are due toobesity, poordiet,lack of physical activityorexcessive alcohol consumption.Other factors include certain infections, exposure toionizing radiation, and environmental pollutants.In thedeveloping world, 15% of cancers are due to infections such asHelicobacter pylori,hepatitis B,hepatitis C,human papillomavirus infection,Epstein–Barr virusandhuman immunodeficiency virus.These factors act, at least partly, by changing thegenesof a cell.Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops.Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects.Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests.It is then typically further investigated bymedical imagingand confirmed bybiopsy.
The risk of developing certain cancers can be reduced by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol intake, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, andwhole grains,vaccinationagainst certain infectious diseases, limiting consumption ofprocessed meatandred meat, and limiting exposure to direct sunlight.Early detection through screening is useful forcervicalandcolorectal cancer.The benefits of screening for breast cancer are controversial.Cancer is often treated with some combination ofradiation therapy, surgery,chemotherapyandtargeted therapy.Pain and symptom management are an important part of care.Palliative careis particularly important in people with advanced disease.The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer andextent of diseaseat the start of treatment.In children under 15 at diagnosis, thefive-year survival ratein thedeveloped worldis on average 80%.For cancer in the United States, the average five-year survival rate is 66% for all ages.
In 2015, about 90.5 million people worldwide had cancer.In 2019, annual cancer cases grew by 23.6 million people and there were 10 million deaths worldwide, representing over the previous decade increases of 26% and 21%, respectively.
The most common types of cancer in males arelung cancer,prostate cancer,colorectal cancer, andstomach cancer.In females, the most common types arebreast cancer, colorectal cancer,lung cancer, andcervical cancer.Ifskin cancerother thanmelanomawere included in total new cancer cases each year, it would account for around 40% of cases.In children,acute lymphoblastic leukemiaandbrain tumorsare most common, except in Africa, wherenon-Hodgkin lymphomaoccurs more often.In 2012, about 165,000 children under 15 years of age were diagnosed with cancer.The risk of cancer increases significantly with age, and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries.Rates are increasing asmore people live to an old ageand as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world.The global total economic costs of cancer were estimated atUS$1.16 trillion  per year as of 2010.
Cancers comprise a large family of diseases that involve abnormalcell growthwith the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.They form a subset ofneoplasms. A neoplasm or tumor is a group of cells that have undergone unregulated growth and will often form a mass or lump, but may be distributed diffusely.
All tumor cells show thesix hallmarks of cancer. These characteristics are required to produce a malignant tumor. They include:
The progression from normal cells to cells that can form a detectable mass to outright cancer involves multiple steps known as malignant progression.
When cancer begins, it produces no symptoms. Signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows orulcerates. The findings that result depend on cancer's type and location. Few symptoms arespecific. Many frequently occur in individuals who have other conditions. Cancer can be difficult to diagnose and can be considered a "great imitator."
People may become anxious or depressed post-diagnosis. The risk of suicide in people with cancer is approximately double.
Local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration. For example, mass effects from lung cancer can block thebronchusresulting in cough orpneumonia;esophageal cancercan cause narrowing of theesophagus, making it difficult or painful to swallow; andcolorectal cancermay lead to narrowing or blockages in thebowel, affecting bowel habits. Masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps.Ulcerationcan cause bleeding that can lead to symptoms such ascoughing up blood,anemiaorrectal bleeding,blood in the urine, orabnormal vaginal bleeding. Although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer, the initial tumor is usually painless. Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest orabdomen.
Systemic symptoms may occur due to the body's response to the cancer. This may include fatigue, unintentional weight loss, or skin changes.Some cancers can cause a systemic inflammatory state that leads to ongoing muscle loss and weakness, known ascachexia.
Some cancers, such asHodgkin's disease,leukemias, andliverorkidney cancers, can cause a persistentfever.
Some systemic symptoms of cancer are caused by hormones or other molecules produced by the tumor, known asparaneoplastic syndromes. Common paraneoplastic syndromes includehypercalcemia, which can causealtered mental state, constipation and dehydration, orhyponatremia, which can also cause altered mental status, vomiting, headaches, or seizures.
Metastasisis the spread of cancer to other locations in the body. The dispersed tumors are called metastatic tumors, while the original is called the primary tumor. Almost all cancers can metastasize.Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has metastasized.
